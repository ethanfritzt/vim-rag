This gives you a personal copy of Vim.  You need to put $HOME/bin in your
path to execute the editor.  Also see |install−home|.
Q: The Colors Are Not Right on My Screen. (Unix)
Check your terminal settings by using the following command in a shell: >        echo $TERMIf the terminal type listed is not correct, fix it.  For more hints, see
|06.2|.  Another solution is to always use the GUI version of Vim, calledgvim.  This avoids the need for a correct terminal setup.
Q: My Backspace And Delete Keys Don't Work Right
The definition of what key sends what code is very unclear for backspace <BS>
and Delete <Del> keys.  First of all, check your $TERM setting.  If there isnothing wrong with it, try this: >
        :set t_kb=^V<BS>
        :set t_kD=^V<Del>
In the first line you need to press CTRL−V and then hit the backspace key.
In the second line you need to press CTRL−V and then hit the Delete key.You can put these lines in your vimrc file, see |05.1|.  A disadvantage isthat it won't work when you use another terminal some day.  Look here foralternate solutions: |:fixdel|.
Q: I Am Using RedHat Linux.  Can I Use the Vim That Comes with the System?
