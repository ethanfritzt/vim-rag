When you installed Vim as a package, check your package manager to find out
how to remove the package again.   If you installed Vim from sources you can use this command: >
        make uninstallHowever, if you have deleted the original files or you used an archive that
someone supplied, you can't do this.  Do delete the files manually, here is anexample for when "/usr/local" was used as the root: >
        rm −rf /usr/local/share/vim/vim61
        rm /usr/local/bin/eview        rm /usr/local/bin/evim        rm /usr/local/bin/ex        rm /usr/local/bin/gview        rm /usr/local/bin/gvim        rm /usr/local/bin/gvim        rm /usr/local/bin/gvimdiff        rm /usr/local/bin/rgview        rm /usr/local/bin/rgvim        rm /usr/local/bin/rview        rm /usr/local/bin/rvim        rm /usr/local/bin/rvim        rm /usr/local/bin/view        rm /usr/local/bin/vim        rm /usr/local/bin/vimdiff        rm /usr/local/bin/vimtutor        rm /usr/local/bin/xxd        rm /usr/local/man/man1/eview.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/evim.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/ex.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/gview.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/gvim.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/gvimdiff.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/rgview.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/rgvim.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/rview.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/rvim.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/view.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/vim.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/vimdiff.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/vimtutor.1        rm /usr/local/man/man1/xxd.1
MS−WINDOWS
If you installed Vim with the self−installing archive you can run
the "uninstall−gui" program located in the same directory as the other Vimprograms, e.g. "c:\vim\vim61".  You can also launch it from the Start menu ifinstalled the Vim entries there.  This will remove most of the files, menuentries and desktop shortcuts.  Some files may remain however, as they need aWindows restart before being deleted.   You will be given the option to remove the whole "vim" directory.  Itprobably contains your vimrc file and other runtime files that you created, sobe careful.
Else, if you installed Vim with the zip archives, the preferred way is to use
the "uninstal" program (note the missing l at the end).  You can find it inthe same directory as the "install" program, e.g., "c:\vim\vim61".  Thisshould also work from the usual "install/remove software" page.   However, this only removes the registry entries for Vim.  You have todelete the files yourself.  Simply select the directory "vim\vim61" and deleteit recursively.  There should be no files there that you changed, but youmight want to check that first.   The "vim" directory probably contains your vimrc file and other runtimefiles that you created.  You might want to keep that.
